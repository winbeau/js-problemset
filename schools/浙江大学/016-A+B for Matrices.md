# A+B for Matrices

#### 题目描述

This time, you are supposed to find $A + B$ where $A$ and $B$ are two matrices, and then count the number of zero rows and columns.

#### 输入格式

The input consists of several test cases, each starts with a pair of positive integers $M$ and $N$ ($\leq 10$) which are the number of rows and columns of the matrices, respectively. Then $2*M$ lines follow, each contains $N$ integers in $[-100, 100]$, separated by a space. The first $M$ lines correspond to the elements of $A$ and the second $M$ lines to that of $B$.

The input is terminated by a zero $M$ and that case must NOT be processed.

#### 输出格式

For each test case you should output in one line the total number of zero rows and columns of $A + B$.
